      <description>We’ve been learning Python recently in our Computational Biology class, so I thought I would share some of the basics and include how R and Python are able to “talk” to each other, through the use of reticulation.
#Python For Python basics, I wanted to showcase how lists can be utilized, and replacements within those can be made through modifications.
Below I generate a list, called “list1” with the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4.</description>

      <description>I am very excited to use this summer to relax and recharge. I was hoping to get an internship, however, I began applying for opportunities later than I had originally hoped. I’m now planning to use my free time to work, relax, and take a mental break before starting up in the fall. I’m not one to love taking breaks, but I think this one is quite necessary. More updates to come!</description>
