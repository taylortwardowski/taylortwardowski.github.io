<p>We’ve been learning Python recently in our Computational Biology class, so I thought I would share some of the basics and include how R and Python are able to “talk” to each other, through the use of reticulation.</p>
<p>#Python
For Python basics, I wanted to showcase how lists can be utilized, and replacements within those can be made through modifications.</p>
<p>Below I generate a list, called “list1” with the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. I then tell Python to put “999” in the 3rd position in the list (the first element is the 0th position). The result is included below.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>list1 = [1,2,3,4]
list1[3]=999
list1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1, 2, 3, 999]</code></pre>
<p>I then tell Python to insert a 4th position with a “5” in it. When I ask Python to return the 4th position of list1, a 5 is returned.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>list1.insert(4,5)
list1[4]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 5</code></pre>
<p>Both of these concepts can be seen in the final list1 we are left with, after telling Python to make the necessary modifications to the list we began with.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>list1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1, 2, 3, 999, 5]</code></pre>
<p>#Reticulating
It is possible for R and Python to communicate through reticulation, but we have to install the package and assign variables in each language first. This is shown below, first in R, then in Python.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(reticulate)

thank &lt;- &quot;Thank&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>thank=&quot;you&quot;
print(r.thank, thank)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Thank you</code></pre>
<p>Utilizing the print function, specifying the order in which we would like our output to appear (using r.x), we are able to combine language from both R and Python to obtain a combined output (shown above).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cat(c(thank,py$thank))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Thank you</code></pre>
<p>Conversely, it’s possible to specify a Python object in R code (using py$x). This gives identical output to what was achieved above, it’s just performed in the opposite language.</p>
<p>I’ve learned so much about both R (and Python) this semester, and I plan to continue learning more about each and maybe even more languages!</p>
