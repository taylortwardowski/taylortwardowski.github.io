I am very excited to use this summer to relax and recharge. I was hoping to get an internship, however, I began applying for opportunities later than I had originally hoped. I'm now planning to use my free time to work, relax, and take a mental break before starting up in the fall. I'm not one to love taking breaks, but I think this one is quite necessary. More updates to come!
