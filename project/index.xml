      <description>Introduction The data set being analyzed here is called Participation; it contains 872 observations with a total of 8 variables, to measure the work force participation in Switzerland. The “X1” variable gives a number to each individual whose data was collected. The “lfp” variable shows labor force participation status with either “yes” or “no”. The “lnnlinc” variable gives the log of the non-labor income. The “age” variable gives the age of the individual in years divided by 10.</description>
